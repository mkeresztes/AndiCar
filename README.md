# AndiCar - Free Trip log & Expense tracker for Android devices

*Unfortunately, Miklos passed away around 2018. I have been in touch with the agency that he worked for, and they would be pleased if somebody from Andicar can continue his work*

**Please note that the app still works on Android 13** If I could figure out where to load the apk, I would. Any help?
